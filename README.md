To run the code:

1) Go into the folder containing all the files within your terminal
2) type "python main.py" and that will get the program started. 

data.txt file contains some values to load whenever using the load command during the program
when you use the create command, make sure the file name that is being created has the ".btree" extension. There is a sample run on my devlog.md page.
