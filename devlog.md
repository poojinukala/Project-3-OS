I didn't read all the way through the instructions and didn't see the part about the github til now. I created the Repo and created the original devlog file on the github page. I worked on the logic behind all the commands (create, open, insert,search,load, print, extract, quit). I'm currently having issues with the insert, search, load and extract as they have to be developed as im creating the index file and B-tree implemetation. I tried pushing into the repo and I was running into some issues with "main" branch. I googled the issues and saw that there is a git push force command and I used this command to push my code. However, this deleted my original devlog file and pushed the code into main branch. I think from now on, I'm going to create another branch and then merge it to the main branch. I attemped my regular push to main and it works now?? I don't know what happened originally but it's working now. No need to do pull and merges.

Started working on the B-Tree Structure. I have to create the B-Tree node class which includes the Block ID, Parent block ID, num of key value pairs, and array of keys, values, and child pointers. I also have to create methods to read and write a node from or to the index file.
